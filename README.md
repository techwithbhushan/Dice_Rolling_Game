# 🎲 Dice Rolling Game - Python Mini Project

This is a simple command-line **Dice Rolling Game** built with basic Python fundamentals. The program simulates the rolling of two six-sided dice and allows the user to roll again or quit.

## 📌 Features
- Random number generation using Python’s `random` module
- Looping and user input handling
- Clear console output for a fun and interactive experience

## 💡 How it Works
- The user is asked if they want to roll the dice.
- If they type `y`, two dice values between 1 and 6 are generated and shown.
- If they type `n`, the program ends with a thank-you message.
- Any other input shows an invalid choice message.

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- Python 3
- Modules: `random`

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Variables
- While loops
